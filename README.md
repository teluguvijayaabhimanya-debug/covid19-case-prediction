# COVID-19 Case Prediction

##  Overview
This project predicts daily new COVID-19 cases for a selected country using historical data. It applies time-series feature engineering and machine learning regression models to forecast future case counts.

##  Dataset
- Source: Our World in Data (COVID-19 Dataset)
- Features include date-wise confirmed cases and related statistics.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

##  Project Workflow
1. Data loading and filtering by country
2. Date conversion and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering using lag values
4. Model training using regression algorithms
5. Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE

##  Results
The trained model predicts future daily COVID-19 cases based on past trends and patterns.

##  Use Cases
- Time-series forecasting practice
- Machine learning mini project
- Academic and resume project

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
